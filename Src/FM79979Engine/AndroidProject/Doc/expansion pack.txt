1.Name

For example, suppose your APK version is 314159 and your package name is com.example.app. If you upload a main expansion file, the file is renamed to:

main.314159.com.example.app.obb

main.4.fm.game.BluffingGirl.obb




2.Location

<shared-storage>/Android/obb/<package-name>/

<shared-storage> is the path to the shared storage space, available from getExternalStorageDirectory().

Ex: sdcard/Android/obb/packagename/main.1.packagename.obb.zip


		string	l_strExternal = getExternalStorageDirectory();
		l_strExternal += "fm.game.BluffingGirl/main.4.fm.game.BluffingGirl.obb.zip";

Set/3/2014

the 4 is the name of apk version
what ever the name you named after you upload to google play,
the file will become 

main.1-n(version).packgae name.obb

main.4.fm.game.BluffingGirl.obb;
