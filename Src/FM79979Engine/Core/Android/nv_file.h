/** @file nv_file.h
  The NvF(ile) library is an abstraction library that makes it possible to
  automatically find files either in Android's /data tree or in the APK
  itself.  The library provides a unified FILE*-like interface to both of
  the file types.  This makes it possible for native applications to migrate
  data between the APK and the /data filesystem without changing application code
