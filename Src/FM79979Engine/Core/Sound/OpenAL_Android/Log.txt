Because NativeActive won't call 

__attribute__((visibility("default"))) jint JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM* vm, void* reserved)

at Android.c

so u have to change code 
static JavaVM* javaVM = NULL;
to 
extern JavaVM* javaVM;

and 
name a JavaVM* javaVM = 0; at main.cpp then 
setup correct javaVM at void android_main(struct android_app* state) 

javaVM = state->activity->vm;
