Hi Larry and Justin,

here are different versions of Twinkle, including audio.

The notes are:
60,60,67,67,69,69,67
CCGGAAG 
65,65,64,64,62,62,60
FFEEDDC
67,67,65,65,64,64,62
GGFFEED
67,67,65,65,64,64,62
GGFFEED
60,60,67,67,69,69,67
CCGGAAG
65,65,64,64,62,62,60
FFEEDDC

The black notes go for 1 count, the white notes for 2 counts (count at a moderate speed, not too fast)?.
