Make sure that gzip compression does not confuse the MIME types that the assets are served with.
 All JavaScript files (precompressed or not) should be best served with the HTTP response header

Content-Type: application/octet-stream. WebAssembly .wasm files should be served with 
Content-Type: application/wasm.
