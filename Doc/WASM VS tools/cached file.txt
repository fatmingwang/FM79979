Providing a Quick Second Time Load

-use-preload-cache


All browsers have an implementation defined limit (20MB or 50MB) for assets,
and files larger than that will bypass the browserâ€™s built-in web caches altogether.
Therefore it is recommended that large .data files are manually cached to IndexedDB by the main page.
The Emscripten linker option --use-preload-cache can be used to have Emscripten implement this,
although it can be desirable to manually manage this on the html page in a custom manner,
since that allows taking control of which database the assets are cached to,
and what kind of scheme will be used to evict data from it.
