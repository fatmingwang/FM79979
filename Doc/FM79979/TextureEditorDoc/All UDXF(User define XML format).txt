UDXF define(or FDXF)

we define image as 2 formats.

1.Static Image
	Include 
		1.1 Common Image(BaseImage,UIImage)
		1.2 Numerial Image
		1.3 PuzzleImage Image
		1.4 Sprite Image(depreciate,old style it could be instead by pullze image)
2.Dynamic Image
	Include
		2.1 ImagePlayer
			-cImageShowInfoState
				-sImageShowInfo
		2.2 MPDIList
			-cMultiPathDynamicImage
				-cCueToStart2DCurvesWithTime
					-sTexBehaviorDataWithImageIndexData


here is format for static image

   below sample include 3 kind format
		Common(BaseImage),UI(UIImage),Numerial(Numerial),Sprite(Sprite)
		you could gather images as you expect to create a file.
	<Image>
		<Common Name="BackGround/BKImage.png" UV="0,0,1,1" />
		<UI Name="388.png" Position="0,0" UV="0,0,1,1" />
		<Numerial Name="CardNI.png" />
		<Sprite Count="4" Row="4" Name="2266.png" TexU="1" TexV="1" />
	</Image>
	
   this is puzzleImage(extension name as *.pi)
	<PuzzleImage Name="79979" Count="6" >
	    <PuzzleUnit Name="ST2StonePart" UV="0,0,0.32875,0.1275," OffsetPos="9,9," />
	    <PuzzleUnit Name="ST3StonePart" UV="0.33,0,0.81875,0.11625," OffsetPos="4,4," />
	    <PuzzleUnit Name="ST4StonePart" UV="0,0.12875,0.3575,0.2525," OffsetPos="11,11," />
	    <PuzzleUnit Name="ST5StonePart" UV="0.35875,0.12875,0.885,0.25375," OffsetPos="52,52," />
	    <PuzzleUnit Name="ST6StonePart" UV="0,0.255,0.33375,0.39125," OffsetPos="30,30," />
	    <PuzzleUnit Name="ST7StonePart" UV="0.335,0.255,0.665,0.38375," OffsetPos="5,5," />
	</PuzzleImage>


here is format for Dynamic image

	SimpleAnimation(extension name as SA)
	TAG:
		ImagePlayer
			Attributes
				Name(you could fetch type ImagePlayer as its name)
				AnimationCount as much cImageShowInfoState
				ImageName is PuzzleImage(here is quite important!!!if puzzleImage could be share as SA and MPDI)
	   	Animation
			Attributes
				Name(you could fetch type cImageShowInfoState as its name)
				PlayCount(how many times to play if value is -1 it's infinety loop)
				AnimationCount as much sImageShowInfo
				MaxImageWidth,MaxImageHeight  to detec maxiuma size for collide(or fetch size in sImageShowInfo)
	   	AnimationData
			Attributes
				Angle
				ShowSec
				ImageName
				OffsetPos
				Size
				Mirror
	sample:
		<ImagePlayer Name="factory_ani_sa" AnimationCount="1" ImageName="factory.pi">
		    <Animation Name="BL_factory_ready" PlayCount="-1" AnimationCount="3" MaxImageWidth="102" MaxImageHeight="107">
		        <AnimationData Angle="0.000000" ShowSec="0.166667" ImageName="BL_factory_ready1" OffsetPos="0,0" Size="102,107" Mirror="0" />
		        <AnimationData Angle="0.000000" ShowSec="0.166667" ImageName="BL_factory_ready2" OffsetPos="0,0" Size="102,107" Mirror="0" />
		        <AnimationData Angle="0.000000" ShowSec="0.166667" ImageName="BL_factory_ready3" OffsetPos="0,0" Size="102,107" Mirror="0" />
		    </Animation>
		</ImagePlayer>



	MPDIList(extension name as mpdi)
	TAG:
		MPDIList
			Attributes
				Name:(you could fetch type MPDIList as its name)
				Count(how many MultiPathDynamicImage)
				ImageName(related puzzleImage)
		MultiPathDynamicImage
			Attributes
				Name:(you could fetch type MultiPathDynamicImage as its name)
				PathCount	how many CueToStart2DCurvesWithTime inside
				TotalPlayTime how long is it play
		CueToStart2DCurvesWithTime
			Attributes
				Name:(you could fetch type CueToStart2DCurvesWithTime as its name)
				StartTime	it's possible have a lot path and wanna to show out at expect time(not all path start at 0).
				Count how many sTexBehaviorDataWithImageIndexData inside
				LOD the path reference LOD data
		CurvePoint
		CurveTime
		PointDataList
			those three store the time and position and sTexBehaviorDataWithImageIndexData data


sample:
<MPDIList Name="factory_ani_mpdi" Count="7" ImageName="factory.pi">
    <MultiPathDynamicImage Name="base" PathCount="1" PlayCount="1" TotalPlayTime="0.000000">
        <CueToStart2DCurvesWithTime Name="base" StartTime="0.000000" Count="2" LOD="1">
            <CurvePoint P0="137.00,574.00" P1="137.00,574.00" />
            <CurveTime P0="0.000000" P1="0.000000" />
            <PointDataList P0="225,86,0.00,255,255,255,255,factory_base,0" P1="225,86,0.00,255,255,255,255,factory_base,0" />
        </CueToStart2DCurvesWithTime>
    </MultiPathDynamicImage>
</MPDIList>
