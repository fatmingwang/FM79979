If you want to target to android 11, you should use the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.

This comes with a big caveat, the app must conform to the Google Play policy for this permission,
 " the appâ€™s usage of the permission must fall within permitted uses,
 and must be directly tied to the core functionality of the app" - so unless your app is a File Manager or Virus scanning
app etc.. I'd advise not to use this permission, otherwise you might find its rejected and have a load of 
refactoring to do.

 Settings > Privacy > Permission manager > Files and media page,
 each app that has the permission is listed under Allowed for all files. If your app targets Android 11,
 keep in mind that this access to "all files" is read-only.





Target any version
The first dialog presents a link called Allow in settings
Figure 1. Dialog shown when an app uses scoped storage and requests the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.
The following changes take effect in Android 11, regardless of your app's target SDK version:

The Storage runtime permission is renamed to Files & Media.
If your app hasn't opted out of scoped storage and requests the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission, users see a different dialog compared to Android 10. The dialog indicates that your app is requesting access to photos and media, as shown in Figure 1.

Users can see which apps have the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in system settings.
 On the Settings > Privacy > Permission manager > Files and media page,
 each app that has the permission is listed under Allowed for all files. If your app targets Android 11,
 keep in mind that this access to "all files" is read-only.
 To read and write to all files in shared storage using this app, you need to have the all files access permission.
