I should note that I haven't had the issue since upgrading my RAM. I can't confirm if it's related but the problem was prevalent when I had 2-4GB RAM. No problems since going to 8 and 16GB.

If only one file/window appears to be affected, close and reopen that file. If that doesn't work, try below.

In Visual Studio:

Click Tools->Options->Text Editor->All Languages->General
Uncheck "Auto list members"
Uncheck "Parameter information"
Check "Auto list members" (yes, the one you just unchecked)
Check "Parameter information" (again, the one you just unchecked)
Click OK
If this doesn't work, here's a few more steps to try:

Close all VS documents and reopen
If still not working, close/reopen solution
If still not working, restart VS.
For C++ projects:
MSDN has a few things to try: MSDN suggestions

The corrupt .ncb file seems most likely.

From MSDN:

Close the solution.
Delete the .ncb file.
Reopen the solution. (This creates a new .ncb file.)
